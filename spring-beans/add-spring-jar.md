## Adding Spring manually 
If you dont want to use Maven, you have to download the spring JARs and add it to the project classpath. 
Download from : https://repo.spring.io/ui/native/release/org/springframework/spring. 
Select the latest release and download the corresponding RELEASE-dist.zip. 
Extract and add it to a folder in your project. 
(Applicable for Eclipse): Right click on project, Properties -> Java Build Path-> Libraries -> ClassPath-> Add Jars (paste the copied jars here) -> Finish

Bean Scope : Default - singleton 
-> singleton - One instance per Spring Context 
-> prototype - New bean whenever requested 
-> request - One bean per HTTP request 
-> session - One bean per HTTP request 

Notes: 
-> If we request different instances of the same bean, we will get a copy of the same bean. In memory there will be only one bean

If we want different beans to be created for the same bean class use: 
-> @Scope("prototype") (but hardcoding it is not good practice)
-> @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)

To ensure a new instance is created every time @Autowired is called, we need to use something called a Proxy in the @Scope Annotation 
: @Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE, proxyMode=ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)

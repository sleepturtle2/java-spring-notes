Component Annotations 

-@Component - Generic Component 
-@Repository - encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior typically from a relational database 
-@Service - Business Service Facade 
-@Controller - Controller in MVC pattern

Except @Component, all others are specific to the layer. @Controller - UI 
layer, @Service - Business Service layer, @Repository - gets data from 
the data layer 

@Service can be replaced with @Component too. So why should we use 
specific annotations. We can identify the annotations and add 
functionality to them. We can categorise our components and apply 
different logic to them.
